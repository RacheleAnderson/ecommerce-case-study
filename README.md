# Data Science for E-Commerce
This folder contains the code for my solution to the case study.

The code is divided in three notebooks: 
- Exploratory analysis: ecommerce_exploratory.ipynb
- Sales predictions: ecommmerce_SARIMA.ipynb, with auxiliary function preprocess_data.py
- Insights from the data: ecommerce_insights.ipynb
